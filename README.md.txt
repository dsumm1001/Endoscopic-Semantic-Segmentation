Link to project dataset:
https://endovissub2017-roboticinstrumentsegmentation.grand-challenge.org/Data/
Note: Have to sign up first before downloading data
Note: Use image generation scripts to generate compatible ground truth images

To run code:
All programs are jupityr notebooks. The file structure should be adapted to fit where the data is stored on your machine. Please install all necessary libraries via pip or otherwise compatible method of choice.

Please reach out @dsummerl@umd.edu or dsumm1001@gmail.com if you want the trained model weights, which I do have stored on my machine! Thanks for a great semester!
